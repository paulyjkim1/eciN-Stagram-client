# eciN-Stagram
be Nice!

## Description
eciN-stagram is a social media app mockup of the fourth most popular social media site world-wide, Instagram. This app allows users to upload images with captions on their pages, as well interact with other user's posts, but with a catch. Using a prebuilt machine learning model, Text Toxicity Classifier from Tensorflow.js, this site prevents users from commenting toxic content (threatening language, insults, obscenities, identity-based hate, or sexually explicit language).
